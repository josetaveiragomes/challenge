Feature: Login

  Scenario: Login button state

    Given the user is in the Login Page
    When he uses any username
    And he uses any password
    Then the Login button should become enabled

  Scenario: Login with standard user

    Given the user is in the Login Page
    When he uses 'standard_user' as username
    And uses 'secret_sauce' as a password
    And presses the Login button
    Then he should have logged in successfully
    And should be redirected to the Inventory Page

  Scenario Outline: Login with invalid user

    Given the user is in the Login Page
    When he uses <Username> as username
    And uses <Password> as a password
    And presses the Login button
    Then he should have not logged in
    And there should be an error message stating: <Message>

  Examples:
  | Username          | Password       | Message                                                                    |
  | 'locked_out_user' | 'secret_sauce' |'Epic sadface: Sorry, this user has been locked out.'                       |
  | 'invalid_user'    | 'secret_sauce' |'Epic sadface: Username and password do not match any user in this service' |

  I could argue these ones below can be bugs, since the Login button should only be enabled if both username and password are typed in,
  So we should never see these messages when pressing the button, but rather somewhere else as help. It is debatable.
  |                   | 'secret_sauce' |'Epic sadface: Username is required'                                        |
  | 'invalid_user'    |                |'Epic sadface: Password is required'                                        |
