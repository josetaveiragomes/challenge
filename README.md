## Installation and execution 

### Using Node
I recommend the installation of node 14.19.1. After node is installed, run the following commands:

* npm i
* npm run wdio

### Using docker
In case you don't want to install node and you have docker, you can just use it in the container directly.

* cd docker
* bash docker.sh
